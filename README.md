# 🏦 Simple Bank System (Python Project)

This is a simple Python project that simulates how a bank handles **transfers**, **deposits**, and **withdrawals** between multiple accounts.  

Each account starts with an initial balance, and you can perform different transactions just like in a real banking system.

## 💡 Project Overview

I built this project to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in Python.  
It focuses on how to model real-world actions (like deposits and transfers) using classes and methods.

The program has a `Bank` class that:
- Stores balances for all accounts  
- Checks if transactions are valid  
- Updates account balances accordingly
